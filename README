This is an open source library for Graph algorithms. 

Graphs have become an essential abstraction of many problems in computer 
science. They are extremely useful in modeling computer networks, social 
networks and various other problems. 

There are various problems on the graph to be solved. These are some-times
efficiently solvable and some times they are NP Hard. This library will take 
care of many problems.
